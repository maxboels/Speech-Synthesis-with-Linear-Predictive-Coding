# Speech-Synthesis-with-Linear-Predictive-Coding
This project attempts to solve the problem of speech synthesis of male and female vowels, and is developed with the help of Matlab software. This objective is reached using the Linear Predictive Code approach to estimate the coefficients and formant frequency. Then, vowels are generated by passing an excitation signal through the modeled filter.
